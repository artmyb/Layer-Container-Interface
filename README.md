This code enables you to activate/disable objects with hierarchical relationship in graphical editing applications.


-Can act as both a parent (containing sublayers or items) and a child (nested within another container).
-Has a checkbox for visibility or activation control.
-Can include optional buttons for deleting the layer or opening its settings.
-Has an expand/collapse mechanism (▶ / ▼) to show or hide its child layers.
-Supports recursive state propagation — if the parent checkbox is toggled, children follow accordingly.
